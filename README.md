- 👋 Hi, and welcome to my GitHub profile:) My name is Maksym Shvets.
- 👀 I’m a third year Data Science student at University of Lodz.
- 👀 I'm currently working as a Junior ML Engineer at Comarch S.A.
- 🌱 I'm interested in building some type of algorithms (search, filter, finding optimal path, math), analysing time complexity and optimising them, but also building and testing Supervised Machine Learning algorithms for classification and regression problems on different datasets.
- 🌱 In my projects I use Python and R with their libraries and frameworks.
